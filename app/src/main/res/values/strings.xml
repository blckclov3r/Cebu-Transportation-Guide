    <string name="history">Jeepneys (Filipino: Dyipne), sometimes called simply jeeps (Filipino: dyip), are the most popular means of public transportation in the Philippines. They are known for their crowded seating and kitsch decorations, which have become a ubiquitous symbol of Philippine culture and art. A Sarao jeepney was exhibited at the Philippine pavilion at the 1964 New York Worlds Fair as a national image for the Filipinos.Jeepneys were originally made from U.S. military jeeps left over from World War II. The word jeepney is likely a portmanteau word â€“ a combination of jeep and jitney, both words common slang in the popular vernacular of the era: jitney being a popular term for an American taxicab, and a jeep a newly coined term to describe a type of military vehicle (origin from General Purpose, or GP, hence Jeep). Other sources favor the far less likely explanation that it is a portmanteau of jeep and knee, because the passengers sit in very close proximity to each other. Most jeepneys are used as public utility vehicles. Some are used as personal vehicles. Jeepneys are used less often for commercial or institutional use. | (c) Wikipedia</string>
